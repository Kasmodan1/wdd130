      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my "About Me" page! My name is Scott Midkiff, and I am a Network Technician based in Grants Pass, Oregon. Located in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, Grants Pass is a wonderful place to call home. With its stunning natural landscapes, friendly community, and abundant recreational opportunities, I feel fortunate to live and work in this amazing part of the country.
When I'm not busy working on IT projects, you can often find me playing the French horn. Music has always been a big part of my life, and I've been playing the horn since I was a teenager. I love the challenge of mastering a new piece of music and the feeling of accomplishment that comes with performing in front of an audience. Whether I'm playing in a community concert or practicing at home, the French horn is a constant source of joy and inspiration in my life.
I believe that my passion for music has helped me develop a strong work ethic and attention to detail, both of which are crucial in the world of IT. As a Network Technician, I understand the importance of precision and accuracy, and I am committed to delivering the best possible results for my clients.
Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. If you have any questions or would like to know more, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
