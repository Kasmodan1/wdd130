    <p>Hello everyone!</p> 
    <p>I am currently living in southwest Oregon for the past 13 years, in a city called Grants Pass. I recently married in 2021, I lived in many states when I was younger so I'm not sure where I should be "from". Something that is unique would be that I am an avid French Horn player. I've played in a few symphonies in my younger years, and now I just play it mostly for entertainment for myself and sometimes others.</p>
    <p> I hope this class will help me gain well-rounded skills and a good basic foundation for html and css. I am hoping to use these skills in my current IT position and future ones to come.</p>
